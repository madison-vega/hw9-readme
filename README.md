# Readme Generator

## Description

Utilizing Node.js I have created a Readme Generator to streamline the processof writing up a good Readme, this project provides a great template to include all the content a good Readme should have.  This can help cut down on the time it takes to manually write it up.

## Installation

You will need to download Node.js to be able to run this project.  You will also need to close the repository to your local machine.

## Usage 

Once you have Node.js installed and the repository cloned you will be able to run the file from the command line in your terminal.  It is important to ensure you are in the correct directory in order to run this successfully.  Once the file initiates, you will be prompted a series of questions to answer, this will be the content used to create the Readme.  Once all questions are answered the user input will be plugged in to a Readme template and the file will be created.

## Credits

I utilized the Good Readme Guide provided by Trilogy as a reference of what sections to include.

## Tests

I tested my project periodically thrughout development by running the file several times to verify bugs and fix the issues.  I also utilized the program to create this Readme.
